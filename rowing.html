<h2>🚣 The Rhythm of the Water🚣</h2>
<h3>For me, rowing is a perfect synthesis of strength, focus, and fluidity. The moment I push off from the dock, the world narrows down to the boat, the blades, and the water stretching out ahead. There is a deeply satisfying rhythm to the stroke—the controlled explosion of the drive, the weightlessness of the recovery, and the clean click of the oars catching the water. This repetitive, powerful motion creates a unique kind of moving meditation, linking breath and muscle, and demanding a total presence of mind. Whether gliding silently at dusk or pushing hard in a competitive piece, the feeling of the boat running cleanly beneath me, propelled by my own effort, is an incomparable experience of power and peace.</h3>
